small update! 1.3_1 will have a new command `arg`!

How do i use it? Using it is super simple! If `macro` or `classFor` has been given extra arguments those are put in the public arguments variable after public arguments gets reset
```hb
macro functionWithArguments argument
```
You can assign a variable to the argument, like this:
```hb
macro repeatMe
in macro repeatMe arg var 0
in macro repeatMe println $var
macro repeatMe argument
: -> prints "argument" or supposed to, i haven't fully tested it. Use it at your own risk!
```
