# HBCL 1 (HighBasic Changelog)
1.1 will be a major update, an update that will change how the entire programming language works.
The programming language will have tons of libraries made with the programming language itself! Cool!

Notes: if an argument name has a `$` before the name, you can reference a variable and get its value to use instead of a literal
### Syntax changes
Variables can be pointers to another variable, this is called indirect referencing. This means it's possible get the value of a variable, referenced by the value of another variable. i.e:
```hb
var foo ""
var pointer "foo"
var $pointer "bar"
println $$pointer
```
Theoretically, you can go on and on for a while. i.e:
```hb
var foo ""
var pointer "foo"
var pointer2 "pointer"
var pointer3 "pointer2"
var pointer4 "pointer3"
var pointer5 "pointer4"
var pointer6 "pointer5"
var pointer7 "pointer6"
var pointer8 "pointer7"
var pointer9 "pointer8"
var pointer10 "pointer9"
var $$$$$$$$$pointer10 "bar"
println $$$$$$$$$$pointer10
```
There are many more practical reasons why you'd need indirect referencing, like... this:
```hb
var cnt 0
var name "item:"

: item:0
var nameConcat ""
concat nameConcat $name $cnt
var val $cnt
operator val 2 *
var $nameConcat $val
operator cnt 1 +

: item:1
var nameConcat ""
concat nameConcat $name $cnt
var val $cnt
operator val 2 *
var $nameConcat $val
operator cnt 1 +

: item:2
var nameConcat ""
concat nameConcat $name $cnt
var val $cnt
operator val 2 *
var $nameConcat $val
operator cnt 1 +

println $item:0
println $item:1
println $item:2
```
### About macros
Macros and indirect referencing are going to change this programming language for the better!
Macros are a list of commands that can be created using `macro <$name>`. To run it, use `macro <$name>` again.
How do i add a command to a macro? Use the command `in macro <$name> <command>`! e.g:
```hb
: Tabs aren't required, but advised for better readability
macro helloWorld
  in macro helloWorld var message "Hello, World!"
  in macro helloWorld println $message

: Run the macro
macro helloWorld
```
NOTE: Last time i've tried this without using the message variable, it cut the "World!" out of "Hello, World!", no idea why that happens. Just use a variable, it works</br>
Remember that last script regarding pointers? A macro can shorten your code and encourage the DRY (don't repeat yourself) act... like this:
```hb
var cnt 0
var name "item:"

macro createNewVariable
  in macro createNewVariable var nameConcat ""
  in macro createNewVariable concat nameConcat $name $cnt
  in macro createNewVariable var val $cnt
  in macro createNewVariable operator val 2 *
  in macro createNewVariable var $nameConcat $val
  in macro createNewVariable operator cnt 1 +

macro createNewVariable
macro createNewVariable
macro createNewVariable

println $item:0
println $item:1
println $item:2
```
### Modules
Modules hold macros and variables the main .hb file can use!
To turn a file into a module, just put `module` with no arguments at the first line, nothing above it, not even comments
To import a module, use `module <$filepath>`
NOTE: filepath is relative to the directory of main.py, even if the .hb file is at the same directory as the module.
`module "subfolder/module.hb"`
### Commands
#### Variables
- `string <$varName> <$val>` converts the value to string and assigns it to the variable
- `num <$varName> <$val>` converts the value to a number (if it can) and assigns it to the variable
- `toNum <$stringVar>` converts a variable's value to a number
- `toString <$stringVar>` converts a variable's value to a string
- `del <var|macro> <$name> [flag]` deletes a variable or macro (to remove all commands from a macro, use the `r` flag to do so)
- `concat <$string> <$string>` is self-explanatory. Concatenates a string value variable
#### Misc
- `group <string>` groups a codeblock together, it has no purpose but to make your code more readable.. like this:
```hb
: Again, tabs aren't necessary, just advised for better readability.
group "Printing Hello, World!"
  macro helloWorld
    in macro helloWorld var message = "Hello, World!"
    in macro helloWorld println $message
    in macro helloWorld del var message
macro helloWorld
```
