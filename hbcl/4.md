Welcome to HBCL 4!
In this new update you are able to use classes! (Or whatever you call them, the classes name is not sticking well)

Commands:
- class <name> (to initialize classes)
- classFor <var> <class> (create a class variable)
- classVal (yeah i might delete this one in the near future, i can't seem to find a use for it)
Fixes:
- fixed "cut" function and it now actually stops loops

About classes:
to reference a class variable, you can use >> inbetween the class and the variable. Like this:
```hb
println class>>variable
```
to set a class variable, you may use . inbetween the class and the variable. Like this:
```hb
var class.variable value
```
running a class macro is easy! just do this (yeah, use . between them. this language is a literal nuthouse.):
```hb
macro class.variable
```
now, if you're in a class macro needing to reference its own variables, you can use this>>variable 
```hb
println this>>variable
```
set its own variable, this.variable
```hb
var this.variable 5
```
run its own macro:
```hb
macro this.variable
```

Here's an example project using classes:
```hb
class Car
in classConstructor Car var this.color "Red"
in classConstructor Car var this.brand "Ford"
in classConstructor Car var this.honkVal "Honk!"
in honk Car println this>>honkVal

classFor car Car
println car>>color
println car>>brand
macro car.honk
```

Oh and forgot to mention, the class macro "classConstructor" if exists will be run after assigning the class to a variable.
and to initalize a class macro to a class, use the `in` keyword following the name of your choice, the class, then the command like this:
```hb
in classMacro class println "Hello,World!"
: No i have not fixed the bug
```

That's pretty much it, but be warned as this may be an unstable update! 1.2_1 is at the hbarchives whenever you need it<3
